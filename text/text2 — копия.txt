Nevertheless this cheerful and commercial side of this holiday attracts some countries, for example, China. 
They have been celebrating Christmas for several years. But this holiday is not in their culture.

And in many countries we can find the same traditions. 
Families decorate a tree, prepare a holiday meal, and wait for 
Santa Claus and his gifts. But each country also has its things. 
In the USA there are garlands of popcorn, and in Sweden there are goats made of straw.

Someone doesnâ€™t celebrate Christmas, but two billion people, 
nearly every third person in the world, celebrate Christmas. 
And this year it will be again, and it will be magic.
